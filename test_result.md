# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# Testing Data - Main Agent and testing sub agent both should log testing data below this section
#====================================================================================================

## user_problem_statement: |
  User requested to add Excel import functionality for inventory data to complement existing order data:
  - Column A: Division (M210 for local production)
  - Column B: Article (unique product code)  
  - Column C: Désignation article (product name and packaging details)
  - Column D: STOCK À DATE (current stock quantity)
  
  The system should cross-reference order requirements with inventory availability and show fulfillment status.
  
  LATEST ENHANCEMENT: Added 20-palette minimum delivery constraint per depot for logistics optimization. 
  - System now calculates total palettes needed per depot
  - If depot has <20 palettes, system suggests additional products to reach minimum
  - Priorities are modified based on delivery efficiency (efficient depots get priority boost, inefficient get reduced priority)
  - Frontend displays delivery optimization summary and efficiency status per item

COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Created realistic test scenarios with mixed depot efficiency, verified efficient depot (114 palettes) vs inefficient depot (0 palettes), confirmed 20-palette constraint logic working perfectly, priority modifications functioning correctly. The 20-palette delivery optimization system transforms basic inventory management into advanced logistics optimization platform that automatically identifies delivery inefficiencies and suggests solutions to minimize transportation costs.

      message: "🚛 TRUCK CALCULATION ENHANCEMENT IMPLEMENTED: Added comprehensive truck calculation functionality to the inventory management system. Backend Features: (1) Added trucks_needed calculation to depot summaries using math.ceil(total_palettes / 24) formula - each truck carries 24 pallets, (2) Enhanced both /api/calculate and /api/enhanced-calculate endpoints with trucks calculation, (3) Added total_trucks to delivery_optimization summary for overall logistics planning. Frontend Features: (1) Replaced 'Min. par Dépôt' with 'Total Camions' display in delivery optimization summary showing total trucks needed across all depots, (2) Enhanced depot details with trucks display showing individual depot truck requirements with proper French pluralization (camion/camions), (3) Styled trucks information with visual indicators matching delivery efficiency status (emerald for efficient, amber for inefficient depots), (4) Added TruckIcon to enhance visual clarity. This enhancement transforms the basic palette tracking into complete logistics planning by providing exact truck requirements for delivery optimization, helping with transportation cost estimation and fleet planning."

      message: "✅ CRITICAL FIXES VERIFICATION COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing confirms both critical fixes are working perfectly! MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS: (1) DATA READING FIX VERIFIED: Excel upload endpoint now properly processes ALL rows including those with missing 'Stock Utilisation Libre' values - system correctly fills missing stock data with 0 and only drops rows with missing essential data (Date de Commande, Quantité Commandée). Tested with 8 rows containing 3 missing stock values - all 8 rows processed successfully. (2) DEPOT ORGANIZATION FIX VERIFIED: Both /api/calculate/{session_id} and /api/enhanced-calculate endpoints now properly organize results by depot with items grouped together and critical items appearing first within each depot group. Verified proper depot grouping (Depot Alpha, Depot Beta, Depot Gamma) with correct priority ordering within each depot. (3) TRUCK CALCULATION ENHANCEMENT VERIFIED: All truck calculation functionality working perfectly across both endpoints - math.ceil(total_palettes / 24) formula accurate, proper integration with 20-palette delivery optimization system, consistent results between basic and enhanced calculations. (4) COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Executed 52/52 backend tests + 5/5 focused critical fix tests with 100% pass rate. All data completeness, depot organization, and truck calculation requirements fully verified. System ready for production use with all critical fixes implemented and tested."
