# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Tester la nouvelle version simplifiée du backend avec les spécifications suivantes :

  **Context:**
  J'ai remplacé le système complexe précédent par une version simplifiée selon les spécifications utilisateur. Le nouveau système utilise 3 fichiers Excel avec des colonnes spécifiques et une formule simplifiée.

  **Nouvelle Architecture:**
  1. **Fichier Commandes** - Colonnes : B(Article), D(Point d'Expédition), F(Quantité Commandée), G(Stock Utilisation Libre)
  2. **Fichier Stock** - Colonnes : A(Division), B(Article), D(STOCK A DATE) - filtré uniquement pour M210
  3. **Fichier Transit** - Colonnes : A(Article), C(Division), G(Division cédante), I(Quantité) - filtré uniquement depuis M210

  **Formule simplifiée:**
  Quantité à Envoyer = max(0, (Quantité Commandée × Jours à Couvrir) - Stock Utilisation Libre - Quantité en Transit)

  **Endpoints à tester:**
  1. `/api/upload-commandes-excel` - Upload fichier commandes
  2. `/api/upload-stock-excel` - Upload fichier stock M210 
  3. `/api/upload-transit-excel` - Upload fichier transit
  4. `/api/calculate` - Calcul avec la nouvelle formule
  5. `/api/export-excel` - Export des résultats
  6. `/api/sessions` - Obtenir les sessions actives

  **Tests spécifiques:**
  1. Tester les uploads avec validation des colonnes spécifiques
  2. Vérifier que M210 est exclu des dépôts destinataires (commandes)
  3. Vérifier que seul M210 est inclus dans le stock
  4. Vérifier que seuls les transits depuis M210 sont inclus
  5. Tester la nouvelle formule de calcul avec différents scénarios
  6. Vérifier que les valeurs négatives sont limitées à 0
  7. Tester l'export Excel
  8. Tester avec données manquantes (stock et/ou transit optionnels)

  **Objectif:** S'assurer que la nouvelle version simplifiée fonctionne correctement selon les spécifications et que la logique de calcul est exacte.

          comment: "MAJOR FORMULA CHANGE: Implemented new calculation formula - Quantité à Envoyer = (CQM x JOURS A COUVRIR) - Stock Transit - Stock Actuel. This formula now allows NEGATIVE values when stock exceeds requirements, removing the max(0, ...) constraint from both /api/calculate/{session_id} and /api/enhanced-calculate endpoints."

          agent: "testing"
          comment: "✅ NEW FORMULA COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: All new formula requirements successfully verified! Executed 4 specialized NEW FORMULA tests with excellent results. KEY ACHIEVEMENTS: (1) BASIC CALCULATION VERIFICATION: Confirmed /api/calculate/{session_id} endpoint correctly implements quantity_to_send = required_stock - current_stock (without max(0, ...)), allowing negative values when current stock exceeds requirements, (2) ENHANCED CALCULATION VERIFICATION: Confirmed /api/enhanced-calculate endpoint correctly implements quantity_to_send = required_stock - transit_available - current_stock, properly handling transit stock in the new formula, (3) NEGATIVE VALUE SCENARIOS: Successfully verified that when current_stock > required_stock OR current_stock + transit_stock > required_stock, the quantity_to_send becomes negative as required, tested with high stock scenario (1000 current stock vs 300 required = -700 quantity_to_send), (4) PALETTE CALCULATION INTEGRATION: Verified palette calculation correctly handles negative quantities (0 palettes for negative quantity_to_send), (5) REGRESSION TESTING: Confirmed all existing functionality preserved - delivery optimization, sourcing intelligence, truck calculations, and all other features work correctly with new formula, (6) COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATION: All 59 backend tests passed (100% success rate), confirming new formula works seamlessly with existing system. CRITICAL FINDINGS: The new formula successfully removes the artificial constraint of non-negative quantities, allowing the system to accurately represent scenarios where current stock exceeds requirements. This provides more realistic inventory management insights. Minor floating-point precision differences (±0.02) observed but within acceptable tolerance. The new formula is production-ready and fully integrated with all existing features."

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS: (1) Basic Functionality: Successfully verified palette_quantity field extraction and calculation for each item, both /api/calculate and /api/enhanced-calculate endpoints working perfectly, (2) Delivery Optimization Logic: Confirmed items properly grouped by depot, depots with ≥20 palettes correctly marked as 'efficient', depots with <20 palettes correctly marked as 'inefficient', priority modifications working (efficient depots get boosts, inefficient get reductions), (3) Smart Filler Suggestions: Verified system suggests additional products from same depot for inefficient depots, suggestions are products that need restocking (quantity_to_send > 0), suggestions sorted by urgency (lowest days of coverage first), limited to top 5 items per depot, (4) Response Structure: All new fields present - palette_quantity, delivery_efficient, delivery_status, delivery_status_color, delivery_optimization summary with depot_summaries working correctly, (5) Edge Cases: Tested exactly 20 palettes (correctly efficient), 0 palettes (correctly inefficient), no filler suggestions when no items need restocking, single vs multiple depot scenarios. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING: Created realistic test scenarios with mixed depot efficiency, verified efficient depot (114 palettes) vs inefficient depot (0 palettes), confirmed 20-palette constraint logic working perfectly, priority modifications functioning correctly. The 20-palette delivery optimization system transforms basic inventory management into advanced logistics optimization platform that automatically identifies delivery inefficiencies and suggests solutions to minimize transportation costs.

      message: "🔧 CRITICAL DATA READING & DEPOT ORGANIZATION FIXES IMPLEMENTED: Fixed two major issues reported by user. (1) Data Reading Fix: Modified Excel upload processing to be less aggressive with row filtering. System now only drops rows with missing essential data (Date de Commande, Quantité Commandée) but keeps rows with missing Stock Utilisation Libre values by filling them with 0. This ensures ALL valid order data is processed. (2) Depot Organization Fix: Updated sorting logic in both /api/calculate and /api/enhanced-calculate endpoints to group results by depot first, then by priority within each depot. Frontend getDisplayedCalculations() also updated to maintain proper depot grouping while ensuring critical items appear first within each depot group. Results table now shows all items from Depot A, then Depot B, etc., instead of random ordering."
