# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Tester la nouvelle version simplifiée du backend avec les spécifications suivantes :

  **Context:**
  J'ai remplacé le système complexe précédent par une version simplifiée selon les spécifications utilisateur. Le nouveau système utilise 3 fichiers Excel avec des colonnes spécifiques et une formule simplifiée.

  **Nouvelle Architecture:**
  1. **Fichier Commandes** - Colonnes : B(Article), D(Point d'Expédition), F(Quantité Commandée), G(Stock Utilisation Libre)
  2. **Fichier Stock** - Colonnes : A(Division), B(Article), D(STOCK A DATE) - filtré uniquement pour M210
  3. **Fichier Transit** - Colonnes : A(Article), C(Division), G(Division cédante), I(Quantité) - filtré uniquement depuis M210

  **Formule simplifiée:**
  Quantité à Envoyer = max(0, (Quantité Commandée × Jours à Couvrir) - Stock Utilisation Libre - Quantité en Transit)

  **Endpoints à tester:**
  1. `/api/upload-commandes-excel` - Upload fichier commandes
  2. `/api/upload-stock-excel` - Upload fichier stock M210 
  3. `/api/upload-transit-excel` - Upload fichier transit
  4. `/api/calculate` - Calcul avec la nouvelle formule
  5. `/api/export-excel` - Export des résultats
  6. `/api/sessions` - Obtenir les sessions actives

  **Tests spécifiques:**
  1. Tester les uploads avec validation des colonnes spécifiques
  2. Vérifier que M210 est exclu des dépôts destinataires (commandes)
  3. Vérifier que seul M210 est inclus dans le stock
  4. Vérifier que seuls les transits depuis M210 sont inclus
  5. Tester la nouvelle formule de calcul avec différents scénarios
  6. Vérifier que les valeurs négatives sont limitées à 0
  7. Tester l'export Excel
  8. Tester avec données manquantes (stock et/ou transit optionnels)

  **Objectif:** S'assurer que la nouvelle version simplifiée fonctionne correctement selon les spécifications et que la logique de calcul est exacte.

MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS: (1) COMPLETE SYSTEM REPLACEMENT VERIFIED: Successfully tested the completely redesigned Excel export functionality replacing the old multi-sheet professional format with the new simplified two-sheet approach as requested, (2) SHEET 1 'TABLE PRINCIPALE' VERIFICATION: Confirmed exact 5 columns as specified (Dépôt | Code Article | Quantité à Livrer | Palettes | Status), verified all data accuracy matches calculation results, confirmed proper data types and status values (OK/À livrer/Non couvert), (3) SHEET 2 'RECOMMANDATIONS DÉPÔTS' VERIFICATION: Confirmed all 9 required columns (Dépôt | Palettes Actuelles | Palettes Cibles | Article Suggéré | Quantité Suggérée | Palettes Suggérées | Stock M210 | Faisabilité | Raison), verified depot-specific recommendations using existing lowest-stock-priority logic, (4) DATA ACCURACY VERIFICATION: All data in both sheets corresponds perfectly to calculation results, mathematical accuracy confirmed for palettes calculation (ceil function), recommendations suggest products with lowest stock quantities from M210, (5) STYLING VERIFICATION: Status-based coloring working correctly (Non couvert = red background, À livrer = orange background, OK = normal), headers have bold styling, frozen panes at A2, customized column widths, feasible recommendations = green background, insufficient stock = red background, (6) RECOMMENDATIONS LOGIC VERIFICATION: Confirmed recommendations use existing lowest-stock-priority logic, suggestions prioritize products with lowest stock quantities, excludes already ordered products for each depot, proper feasibility analysis (Réalisable/Stock insuffisant), all reasons mention 'Stock faible' indicating low stock priority, (7) EDGE CASES TESTING: Empty selection properly rejected with 400 error, single item export successful, depot efficiency scenarios handled correctly, (8) COMPLETE WORKFLOW TESTING: Successfully uploaded sample commandes/stock M210/transit data, performed calculations with 4 results, exported Excel with both sheets, verified all mathematical accuracy and business logic. The new two-sheet export format is production-ready and fully compliant with all review requirements. System successfully replaced old format while maintaining all existing functionality and optimization logic."
