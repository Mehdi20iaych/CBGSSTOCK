# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## user_problem_statement: |
  User requested improvements to the CBGS stock management system:
  1. Add "select all" option to "Filtrer par Produits" section
  2. Modify "Filtrer par Emballage" to only show verre, pet, and ciel (dynamically based on Excel data)
  3. Improve AI assistant but keep design unchanged

          comment: "✅ TESTED: Packaging filter enhancement working correctly. Upload endpoint returns only allowed packaging types (verre, pet, ciel) that exist in data. Sample file with mixed packaging types (including Canette, Tétra) correctly filtered to show only Pet and Verre. Display names properly formatted (e.g., 'Pet' -> 'Bouteille en Plastique (PET)'). Calculation endpoints work correctly with packaging filters."

Enhanced context provides intelligent responses with precise data statistics (650 units total, 26-day period, 333 average stock). Responses are appropriately concise (2-4 sentences, 300-500 chars), professional, and in French. Multiple query types tested successfully: consumption analysis, stock trends, restocking needs, volume statistics. AI correctly identifies data limitations and provides actionable insights."

      message: "✅ BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE: Both high-priority backend tasks are working perfectly. 1) Packaging filter enhancement: Successfully filters to only allowed types (verre, pet, ciel) from uploaded data, with proper display names. 2) AI assistant improvements: Provides intelligent, concise responses with precise statistics in French. Core functionality (upload, calculation, filters, export) all working. Minor: Error handling returns 500 instead of expected 4xx codes, but doesn't affect functionality. Backend is ready for production."
